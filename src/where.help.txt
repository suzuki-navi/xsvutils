where, filter subcommand
    Print records which satisfy a condition.

    `where` subcommand is the same as `filter` subcommand.

    Usage:
        $ xsvutils where <COLUMN> <OPERATOR> <VALUE>

    Parameter:
        <COLUMN>   column name as left-hand operand
        <OPERATOR> operator
        <VALUE>    value as right-hand operand

    Operator:
        ==   column value is numerically equal to the right value
        !=   column value is numerically not equal to the right value
        >    column value is numerically greater than the right value
        >=   column value is numerically greater than or equal to the right value
        <    column value is numerically less than the right value
        <=   column value is numerically less than or equal to the right value
        eq   column value is stringwise equal to the right value
        ne   column value is stringwise not equal to the right value
        gt   column value is stringwise greater than the right value
        ge   column value is stringwise greater than or equal to the right value
        lt   column value is stringwise less than the right value
        le   column value is stringwise less than or equal to the right value
        =~   column value matches the right regular expression
        !~   column value does not match the right regular expression

    Options:
        --help    Print help information about this subcommand.

    注意:
        `>` や `<` はシェルではエスケープが必要である。

    例
        $ xsvutils FILENAME where num \>= 10  # num 列が10以上の数値を抽出
